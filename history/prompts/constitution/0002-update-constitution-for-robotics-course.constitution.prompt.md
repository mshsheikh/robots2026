# Update Constitution for Robotics Course

## Prompt Text
```
```/sp.constitution
Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course
Owner: Salman
Principles:
 - small, token-efficient prompts and outputs
 - spec-driven pipeline: spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> phr
 - preserve all history under history/prompts
 - use feature branches for implementation
 - avoid committing local venv; use requirements.txt
Output: YAML constitution only (6 lines max)
```
```

## Response Text
Updated the project constitution to reflect the specified principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course. The new constitution includes principles for small, token-efficient prompts, spec-driven pipeline, preserving history, using feature branches, and avoiding committing local venv. The version was updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0.

## Outcome
The constitution has been successfully updated with the new principles and governance rules as requested.

## Evaluation
The constitution now properly reflects the project's core principles and governance structure. The update follows the spec-driven approach and maintains proper versioning.
