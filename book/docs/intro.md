# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This educational journey explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing specifically on humanoid systems that interact with the physical world.

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate in digital spaces to intelligent agents that must understand and manipulate the physical environment. This field combines machine learning, robotics, control theory, and cognitive science to create systems capable of perceiving, reasoning about, and acting in three-dimensional space.

Humanoid robotics, as a subset of physical AI, focuses on creating robots with human-like form and capabilities. These systems offer unique advantages in human environments, as they can navigate spaces designed for humans and potentially interact more naturally with people.

Throughout this course, you will explore the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and future possibilities of these technologies. We'll examine how modern AI techniques enable robots to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and perform complex tasks that require both cognitive and physical dexterity.

The curriculum is structured across 13 weeks, with each week building upon previous concepts to provide a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly evolving field. You'll encounter both the challenges and exciting opportunities that define the current state of humanoid robotics research and development.
