# Week 8: AI Integration in Humanoid Systems

## Introduction to AI for Humanoid Robots
This week covers the essential concepts of integrating artificial intelligence into humanoid robotic systems.

- **Learning from Demonstration**: Techniques for humanoid robots to learn new behaviors from human demonstrations, including imitation learning and behavioral cloning.

- **Reinforcement Learning Applications**: Using RL for motor skill acquisition, gait optimization, and adaptive behavior in humanoid robots with continuous action spaces.

- **Planning and Reasoning**: Integrating high-level AI planning with low-level motor control for complex task execution and problem solving.

This knowledge enables the development of more autonomous and adaptable humanoid robots.
