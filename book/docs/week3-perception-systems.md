# Week 3: Perception Systems for Humanoid Robots

## Introduction to Robot Perception
This week covers the essential concepts of perception systems, which enable humanoid robots to understand and interact with their environment.

- **Sensor Integration**: Understanding cameras, LiDAR, IMU, and force/torque sensors - how to combine multiple sensory inputs for robust environmental understanding and state estimation.

- **Computer Vision for Robotics**: Object detection, tracking, and recognition techniques specifically adapted for robotic applications, including 3D reconstruction and scene understanding.

- **SLAM Fundamentals**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping techniques that allow robots to build maps of unknown environments while tracking their position within them.

This knowledge provides the foundation for developing humanoid robots that can perceive and respond to their environment effectively.
