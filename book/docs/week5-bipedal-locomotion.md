# Week 5: Bipedal Locomotion Principles

## Introduction to Humanoid Walking
This week covers the essential concepts of bipedal locomotion, which is fundamental to humanoid robot mobility.

- **Walking Gaits and Patterns**: Understanding the physics of bipedal walking, including single and double support phases, zero-moment point (ZMP) theory, and dynamic balance.

- **Balance Control**: Techniques for maintaining stability during walking, including feedback control, preview control, and recovery strategies for perturbations.

- **Terrain Adaptation**: Methods for adapting walking patterns to different surfaces and obstacles, including stair climbing, stepping over objects, and walking on uneven terrain.

This knowledge provides the foundation for developing stable and versatile walking capabilities in humanoid robots.
