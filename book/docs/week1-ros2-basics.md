# Week 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Introduction to Robot Operating System 2

This week covers the essential concepts of ROS 2, the middleware framework that powers most modern robotics applications.

- **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions - the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 communication patterns and how they enable distributed robotics systems.

- **Package Management & Tools**: Working with ROS 2 packages, workspaces, and development tools including ros2 CLI, rqt, and rviz for effective robotics development and debugging workflows.

- **Practical Implementation**: Creating your first ROS 2 package, implementing basic publishers/subscribers, and testing with simulation environments to establish a foundation for advanced robotics development.

This foundational knowledge provides the necessary tools to develop more complex humanoid robotics applications in subsequent weeks.
