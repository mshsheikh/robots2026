# Week 9: Human-Robot Interaction

## Introduction to Social Robotics
This week covers the essential concepts of human-robot interaction for humanoid platforms.

- **Communication Modalities**: Understanding speech, gesture, and facial expression recognition and generation for natural human-robot communication.

- **Social Cognition**: Modeling human social behavior, intention recognition, and appropriate response generation for socially acceptable robot behavior.

- **Trust and Acceptance**: Factors affecting human acceptance of humanoid robots and design principles for building trust and effective collaboration.

This knowledge enables the development of humanoid robots that can interact naturally and effectively with humans.
