# Week 4: Control Theory for Humanoid Systems

## Introduction to Robot Control
This week covers the essential concepts of control theory applied specifically to humanoid robotic systems.

- **Classical Control Methods**: PID controllers, system modeling, and stability analysis - foundational techniques for controlling single-joint and multi-joint robotic systems with precision.

- **Advanced Control Techniques**: Adaptive control, robust control, and model predictive control approaches for handling uncertainties and disturbances in humanoid locomotion and manipulation.

- **Whole-Body Control**: Coordinated control of multiple subsystems simultaneously, including balance control, inverse kinematics, and force control for complex humanoid behaviors.

This knowledge enables the development of stable and responsive control systems for humanoid robots operating in dynamic environments.
