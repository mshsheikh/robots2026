# Week 2: Motion Planning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Motion Planning
This week covers the essential concepts of motion planning, which is critical for humanoid robots to navigate complex environments and perform tasks safely.

- **Configuration Space**: Understanding C-space, obstacles, and pathfinding algorithms - the mathematical foundations for planning robot movements in constrained environments.

- **Path Planning Algorithms**: Exploring A*, RRT, and PRM algorithms for finding collision-free paths, with practical implementation considerations for real-time robotics applications.

- **Trajectory Generation**: Creating smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories from planned paths, considering robot dynamics and environmental constraints for safe execution.

This foundational knowledge provides the tools to develop navigation systems for humanoid robots in both structured and unstructured environments.
