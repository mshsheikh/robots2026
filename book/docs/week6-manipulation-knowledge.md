# Week 6: Manipulation and Grasping

## Introduction to Robotic Manipulation
This week covers the essential concepts of manipulation and grasping for humanoid robots.

- **Kinematics and Dynamics**: Forward and inverse kinematics for multi-link arms, Jacobian matrices, and dynamic modeling for manipulation tasks.

- **Grasping Strategies**: Analysis of different grasp types, grasp planning algorithms, and force distribution for stable object manipulation.

- **Task Execution**: Coordinated manipulation tasks including pick-and-place, tool use, and bimanual manipulation using both arms simultaneously.

This knowledge enables humanoid robots to interact effectively with objects in their environment for complex manipulation tasks.
