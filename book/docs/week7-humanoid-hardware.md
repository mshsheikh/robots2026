# Week 7: Humanoid Robot Hardware Design

## Introduction to Hardware Design
This week covers the essential concepts of designing hardware for humanoid robots.

- **Actuator Systems**: Understanding different types of actuators (servo motors, series elastic actuators, hydraulic systems) and their trade-offs in terms of power, precision, and safety.

- **Sensing Systems**: Designing integrated sensor networks for proprioception, exteroception, and environment awareness in humanoid platforms.

- **Mechanical Design**: Principles of lightweight, robust mechanical design that balances strength, weight, and range of motion for human-like movement.

This knowledge provides the foundation for understanding the constraints and possibilities in humanoid robot hardware design.
